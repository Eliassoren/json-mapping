    <!-- Invalidated redirect: Unvalidated redirects occur when an application redirects a user
     to a destination URL specified by a user supplied parameter that is not validated.
     Such vulnerabilities can be used to facilitate phishing attacks.

     Solution/Countermeasures:
      Don't accept redirection destinations from users
      Accept a destination key, and use it to look up the target (legal) destination
      Accept only relative paths
      White list URLs (if possible)
      Validate that the beginning of the URL is part of a white list

      We must be confident that we handle this issue.
